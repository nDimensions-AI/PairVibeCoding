# Use Case 1: Startup MVP - Text-to-UI Development

## Overview
Transform your business idea into a complete multi-page MVP application using text prompts. Perfect for rapid prototyping and startup validation.

## Prerequisites
- Access to Google Stitch (stitch.withgoogle.com)
- Clear business requirements
- Brand guidelines (colors, fonts, style preferences)

## Step-by-Step Process

### 1. Define Your Requirements
Before starting, clearly outline:
- **Business Purpose**: What problem does your app solve?
- **Target Audience**: Who are your users?
- **Core Features**: What are the essential functionalities?
- **Brand Identity**: Colors, tone, visual style

### 2. Create the Landing Page

#### Initial Prompt Template:
```
Create a UI for a landing page for [YOUR SERVICE/PRODUCT] called '[APP NAME]'. 
The design should be [STYLE ADJECTIVES] using a [COLOR PALETTE]. 
Feature a prominent headline '[YOUR HEADLINE]' with a '[CTA BUTTON TEXT]' button. 
Below, display [NUMBER] service/feature cards for '[FEATURE 1]', '[FEATURE 2]', and '[FEATURE 3]', 
each with a short description and an icon.
```

#### Example (Home Cleaning Service):
```
Create a UI for a landing page for a home cleaning service called 'Sparkle'. 
The design should be modern and trustworthy, using a light blue (#ADD8E6) and white palette. 
Feature a prominent headline 'Your Home, Brilliantly Clean' with a 'Book Now' button. 
Below, display three service cards side-by-side for 'Basic Clean', 'Deep Clean', 
and 'Eco-Friendly Options', each with a short description and an icon.
```

### 3. Refine Using Chat Commands

#### Color Refinement:
```
Change the primary color to a more vibrant, modern [COLOR NAME]. 
Make the button corners more rounded.
```

#### Style Adjustments:
```
Make the design feel more [ADJECTIVE: premium/friendly/professional]. 
Adjust the typography to be more [STYLE: bold/elegant/playful].
```

### 4. Build Additional Pages

#### Pricing Page Prompt:
```
Create a pricing page for '[APP NAME]'. Use the same [COLOR] and [STYLE] theme. 
Design a [NUMBER]-column layout for the '[TIER 1]', '[TIER 2]', and '[TIER 3]' tiers. 
Each column should be a card with a title, a checklist of included services, 
and a large price at the bottom with a '[CTA TEXT]' button.
```

#### About Us Page Prompt:
```
Design an 'About Us' page for '[APP NAME]' that feels [TONE: warm/professional/innovative]. 
Start with a headline '[MISSION HEADLINE]'. Below, create a section with a grid of 
[NUMBER] circular placeholders for team photos, with a name and title underneath each. 
Use the established [COLOR] and [STYLE] '[APP NAME]' theme.
```

#### Contact Page Prompt:
```
Create a 'Contact Us' page for '[APP NAME]'. Use a two-column layout. 
The left column should have a simple contact form with fields for [FIELD LIST]. 
The right column should display a placeholder for a map, with an address 
and phone number below it.
```

### 5. Ensure Design Consistency

#### Button Consistency:
```
Make all buttons [SHAPE: rounded pill/square/rounded] with a [COLOR] background, 
matching the style across all pages.
```

#### Typography Consistency:
```
Ensure all headings use [FONT STYLE] and body text uses [FONT STYLE] 
for consistency across pages.
```

## Best Practices

### Prompt Writing Tips:
1. **Be Specific**: Include exact colors, dimensions, and layout preferences
2. **Use Brand Language**: Incorporate adjectives that reflect your brand personality
3. **Reference Existing Elements**: When adding new pages, reference the established design system
4. **Iterate Gradually**: Make small refinements rather than complete overhauls

### Design Considerations:
- **Mobile Responsiveness**: Always consider how your design will look on mobile devices
- **User Flow**: Ensure logical navigation between pages
- **Call-to-Action Placement**: Make CTAs prominent and action-oriented
- **Trust Elements**: Include testimonials, security badges, or team photos for credibility

### Common Refinement Commands:
```
- "Make the layout more spacious with increased padding"
- "Add subtle shadows to the cards for depth"
- "Increase the contrast for better accessibility"
- "Make the navigation menu sticky/fixed"
- "Add hover effects to interactive elements"
```
