# v0.dev Quick Reference Guide

This guide provides a high-level overview of the core generative capabilities of v0.dev, as demonstrated in our masterclass. A modern developer uses the right tool for each specific job to maximize velocity and quality.

### Core Generative Workflows

#### 1. **Pure Generation (Text-to-UI)**
The most fundamental workflow. You provide a detailed text prompt describing the UI's structure, functionality, and style.
* **Best for:** Creating novel components from scratch, highly specific UI elements, and when you have a clear vision that can be described in words.
* **Key Feature:** Iterative prompting (follow-up prompts) allows for progressive refinement of the generated component.

#### 2. **One-Click Starters (`Landing Page`, `Sign Up Form`)**
These are pre-defined templates for common UI patterns that give you a high-quality starting point in a single click.
* **Best for:** Accelerating the creation of common layouts, saving time on boilerplate structure.
* **Key Feature:** The generated components are fully editable and can be customized with follow-up prompts, just like a component generated from scratch.

#### 3. **Clone a Screenshot**
v0.dev can analyze an image of an existing UI and generate a new React component that captures its style, layout, and aesthetic.
* **Best for:** Drawing inspiration from the real world, matching a specific visual style without having the source code, and quickly prototyping ideas based on existing designs.
* **Key Feature:** v0 separates style from content, allowing you to populate the cloned layout with your own text, icons, and data.

#### 4. **Import from Figma**
This provides a direct bridge from a professional design tool to production-ready code. v0.dev analyzes a Figma file's structure, auto-layout, and components to generate a near-perfect React equivalent.
* **Best for:** High-fidelity design handoffs, ensuring pixel-perfect accuracy, and working within an established design system.
* **Key Feature:** The imported design is not a static image; it's a fully interactive component that can be further refined with prompts.

#### 5. **Upload a Project**
v0.dev can analyze existing code (e.g., a single component file) to learn its stylistic conventions (fonts, colors, button styles). It can then generate new components that automatically match that style.
* **Best for:** Ensuring design consistency when adding new features to an existing project, creating components that feel native to your codebase.
* **Key Feature:** Promotes a consistent design language without needing a formal design system.

#### 6. **Full-Stack Starters (`Next.js`, `Supabase`, etc.)**
This goes beyond UI generation. v0.dev can scaffold an entire, production-ready, full-stack application foundation with a single click.
* **Best for:** Starting a new project with a solid architectural foundation, integrating with backend services like databases and authentication from day one.
* **Key Feature:** Generates not just UI code, but also server-side logic, API routes, database clients, and environment setup.
