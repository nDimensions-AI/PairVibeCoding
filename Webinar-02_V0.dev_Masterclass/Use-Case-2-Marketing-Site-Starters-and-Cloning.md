# Use Case 2: The Marketing Site - Starters & Screenshot Cloning

**Goal:** Demonstrate how to accelerate the creation of a full `Site` by combining a one-click `Landing Page` starter with the `Clone a Screenshot` feature for unique customizations.

---

### Scenario: "Helios" Marketing Website

**Requirement:** Quickly build a unique, high-fidelity marketing site for a futuristic carbon-capture startup.

#### **Step 1: Generate the Foundation with a Starter**

Instead of prompting the entire layout, we use a starter to get a professional structure instantly.

**Action:**
1.  Click the **`Landing Page`** one-click starter button in the v0.dev interface.
2.  A full, multi-section landing page is generated.

#### **Step 2: Customize the Hero Section with a Prompt**

We refine the generated hero section to match the "Helios" brand.

**Refinement Prompt:**
> "Change the headline to 'Rewriting the Atmosphere.' The sub-headline should be 'Helios is capturing humanity's carbon footprint, one ton at a time.' Replace the background image with a video of clean, swirling air."

#### **Step 3: Replace a Section with Screenshot Cloning**

The template's feature section is generic. We use a screenshot of a design we like as inspiration for a new, unique block.

**Action:**
1.  Click the **`Clone a Screenshot`** button.
2.  Upload an image of a modern, clean feature grid.

**Content Population Prompt:**
This prompt tells v0 to use the *style* of the screenshot but with our *content*.
> "Use the layout and style from this screenshot to create a 3-column feature section. The features are: 1. 'Quantum-Core Audio Driver' with a soundwave icon. 2. '24-Hour Adaptive Battery' with a battery icon. 3. 'AI-Powered Noise Cancellation' with a brain icon."
