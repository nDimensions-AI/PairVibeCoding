### Scenario 1: Interactive Pricing Slider (`Component`)

**Requirement:** Create a dynamic pricing slider that updates visually and numerically based on user input.

#### **Initial Functional Prompt:**
This prompt describes the structure and behavior of the component.

> "Create an interactive pricing slider component. It should have a slider for selecting user seats, from 1 to 100. Below the slider, display three cards: 'Starter', 'Pro', and 'Business'. As the user moves the slider, the corresponding card should light up with a colored border. Each card must show the dynamically calculated monthly price and a list of features that unlocks at that tier."

#### **Stylistic Refinement Prompt:**
This follow-up prompt applies a premium, futuristic theme to the functional component.

> "Make the slider track a gradient from light blue to purple. The slider's thumb should be a glowing orb. For the highlighted pricing card, give it a subtle 'breathing' glow effect on its border. Use a modern, sleek sans-serif font throughout."

### Scenario 2: Onboarding Modal (`Block`)

**Requirement:** Create a multi-step onboarding modal that combines several UI elements and includes animations.

#### **Initial Structural Prompt:**
This prompt builds the layout of the modal block.

> "Create a modal component for a 4-step user onboarding flow. At the top, include a progress bar that shows the current step. In the middle, add a placeholder for content for 'Step 1: Welcome'. At the bottom, add a 'Back' button (disabled) and a 'Next' button."

#### **Behavioral & Animation Prompt:**
This follow-up prompt adds a transition effect to enhance the user experience.

> "When the 'Next' button is clicked, animate the content section with a subtle slide-in-from-right transition."
