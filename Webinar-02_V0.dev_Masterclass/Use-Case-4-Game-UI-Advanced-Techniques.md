# Use Case 4: The Game UI - Advanced Techniques

**Goal:** Demonstrate how to create a highly stylized `Game` UI and use the `Upload a Project` feature to ensure design consistency with existing code assets.

---

### Scenario: "Neural-Net Runner" Game Interface

**Requirement:** Design a futuristic Heads-Up Display (HUD) and a settings menu that matches the style of a pre-existing component.

#### **Step 1: Generate the Complex HUD with a Detailed Prompt**

A game HUD is highly specific and best created with a detailed descriptive prompt.

**Initial Prompt:**
> "Design a game HUD UI. In the top left, create two overlapping, glowing radial progress bars for 'Cognitive Drift' and 'Neural Sync'. In the bottom left, a scrolling combat-log style text box for 'Subconscious Intrusions'. In the top right, a vertical bar that acts as a 'System Shock' warning meter, which glows red at the top. The entire UI should be translucent and feel like it's projected onto glass."

#### **Step 2: Ensure Style Consistency with `Upload a Project`**

We need a settings menu, but it must match the style of a simple `button.jsx` component we pretend already exists in our project.

**Action:**
1.  Click the **`Upload a Project`** button.
2.  Select and upload the `button.jsx` file. v0.dev analyzes its code to learn its styling (colors, fonts, border-radius, etc.).

#### **Step 3: Generate a New Component in the Learned Style**

Now, we prompt for the new settings menu, telling v0 to use the style it just learned from the uploaded file.

**Generation Prompt:**
> "Now, create a settings modal for the game. It should have toggle switches for 'Subtitles' and 'Haptic Feedback', and a slider for 'Master Volume'. Generate it in the same style as the project I just uploaded."
